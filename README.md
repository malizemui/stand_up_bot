AI implementation of a 'Stand-Up Bot' for the automated software engineering workshop

This is a basic implementation of a stand-up bot that reminds people to take periodic breaks from sitting. It uses Python's built-in scheduler to set timed reminders.

The stand-up bot will print a reminder message telling the user to "stand up and take a break." This reminder repeats on an hourly interval.

Pros/Cons of software engineering with ChatGPT

Pros:
  - Simpler coding - ChatGPT can produce simple, readable code to implement straightforward tasks, allowing engineers to focus on more complex problems.

Cons:
   - Lack of context without understanding the full complexity of systems and constraints, its code may need significant rework.
